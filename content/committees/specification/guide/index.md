## Introduction {#intro}

This guide is a step-by-step practical guide to help Jakarta EE Specification projects navigate the steps of the Jakarta EE Specification Process ([JESP](http://localhost:1313/about/jesp/)). 
It is meant as a helpful tool, so if in doubt, alway refer to the [JESP](http://localhost:1313/about/jesp/) for completeness. Please do not hesitate to contact the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) if you have any questions or comments about anything related to the development of Jakarta EE Specifications.

## Creation Review {#creation}

* A Jakarta Specification is developed by a Specification Project. The Eclipse Development Process is followed, with a few additions.

### Steps Involved

1. Create a Project Proposal (*).
2. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[creation review template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/creation_review_pr_template.md)**.
3. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to request a creation review.

(*) It may be a good idea to socialize the idea with the Specification Committee to solicit support before proceeding with the project creation.

## Plan Review {#plan}

* Each specification project needs to engage in a Plan Review prior to any extensive development effort in support of a new Specification Version. 

### Steps Involved

1. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[plan review template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/plan_review_pr_template.md)**.
2. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to request a plan review.

## Progress Review {#progress}

![Progress Review](JESP_progress-review.png)

* A progress review can be initiated by the project when they want to inform the specification committee about their progress, but are not ready for a release yet.
* A progress review may be requested by the specification committee if no progress has been made in 12 months.

### Steps Involved

1. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[progress review template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/progress_review_pr_template.md)**.
2. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to request a plan review.

## Release Review {#release}

![Release Review](JESP_release-review.png)

* A final version of a specification cannot be made generally available until after engaging in a successful release review (with corresponding super-majority approval from the specification committee).

### Steps Involved

1. Submit a Pull Request to the [Jakarta EE Specifications repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) using the **[release review template](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/pull_request_template.md)**.
2. Send an email to the [Specification Committee](mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org) to request a release review.
